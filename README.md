Smart Sensors Shield for ESP8266 IoT Board

![Banner](https://github.com/grafisoft/Smart-Sensors-Shield/blob/master/SensorsShield.png)

Work in progress!!

  This shield can individually power control for any connector. All bus lines are isolated and individually controlled. You can use it with project board: https://github.com/grafisoft/SpainLabsIoT2018

  - 500mA common for 3,3v sockets.
  - 1A for 5v socket.
  Socket types: 
  - 4x I2C connectors. 3,3v.
  - 1x I2C connector with interruption pin 3.3v.
  - 1x ADC 18bits 1CH connector (3,3v).
  - 1x UART 3,3v
  - 1x UART 5v
  - 1x Pluviometer connector or other type sensor.
  - 1x Direct to ESP8266 connector
  - 2.00mm connectors.
  - Basic interrupts management.
  
  This board have more footprint than necessary. ItÂ´s perfect for prototype and different types of sensors. With modular design, it is not necessary get and solder all components.
  
  If you like this board/project, I will could carry to another platform [NodeMCU, Particle, Father, etc]. Please, leave feedback. Thanks.
